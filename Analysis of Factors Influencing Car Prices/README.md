# Car Price Prediction using Geely Auto Dataset

## Overview

This project aims to predict car prices based on the Geely Auto Dataset. The dataset includes various features such as car specifications, engine details, and other relevant parameters. Machine learning techniques are employed to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car given its features.

## Dataset

The Geely Auto Dataset is included in the `data` directory. It contains the necessary data for training and testing the machine learning model. The dataset is in CSV format, and you can explore it to understand the available features.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Car-Price-Prediction-using-Geely-Auto-Dataset.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Car-Price-Prediction-using-Geely-Auto-Dataset
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After installation, you can use the provided Jupyter notebooks to explore the dataset, train the model, and make predictions. The main notebooks are:

- `1_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Explore and visualize the dataset.
- `2_Model_Training.ipynb`: Train the machine learning model.
- `3_Prediction.ipynb`: Use the trained model to make predictions.

## Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using the `2_Model_Training.ipynb` notebook. In this notebook, various algorithms are tested, and the best-performing model is saved for future predictions.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. You can find the evaluation results in the respective notebook.
